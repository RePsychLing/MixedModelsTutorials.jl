        "# Linear mixed-effects models\n### Douglas Bates\n\nAs described in the last section a _mixed-effects model_ or, more simply, a _mixed model_ incorporates both _fixed-effects_ parameters and _random effects_.  The random effects are associated with the levels of one or more _grouping factors_, which typically are _experimental units_ or _observational units_, such as `subject` or `item`. When we have several observations on each of several subjects, say, we may expect to see subject-to-subject variability in the response but assessing this variability is not the primary purpose of the data analysis.  Instead we wish to control for this level of variability in assessing difference in experimental factors.\n\nFor example, the [`sleepstudy`](https://rdrr.io/cran/lme4/man/sleepstudy.html) dataset in the [`lme4`](https://github.com/lme4/lme4) package for `R` is from a study on the effect of sleep deprivation on reaction time.  A sample from the population of interest (long-distance truck drivers) had their average response time measured when they were on their regular sleep schedule and after one up to nine days of sleep deprivation (allowed only 3 hours per day in which to sleep)."

        "Each panel shows the data from one subject as well as a simple linear regression line fit to that subject's data only.  The panels are ordered by increasing intercept of the within-subject line rwo-wise, starting at the bottom left.  Some subjects, e.g. 310 and 309, have fast reaction times and are almost unaffected by the sleep deprivation.  Others, e.g. 337, start with slow reaction times which then increase substantially after sleep depreivation.\n\nA suitable model for these data would include an intercept and slope for the \"typical\" subject and randomly distributed deviations from these values for each of the observed subjects.  The assumed distribution of the random effects vector is multivariate Gaussian with mean zero (because they represent deviations from the population parameters) and an unknown covariance matrix, $\\Sigma$, to be estimated from the data.\n\nBecause $\\Sigma$ is a covariance matrix it must be symmetric and be positive-definite, a condition that is similar to the requirement that a scalar variance must be positive.  In particular, a positive-definite matrix like $\\Sigma$ has a \"square root\" in the sense that there is a matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ such that $\\Sigma=\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^\\prime$.  (Multiplying by $\\mathbf{L}^\\prime$ instead of squaring $\\mathbf{L}$ is necessary to ensure that the product is symmetric.)  In fact, there are several such matrices $\\mathbf{L}$.  If we require that $\\mathbf{L}$ is lower triangular and that its diagonal entries be positive, there is only one such matrix, which is called the lower (or left) Cholesky factor.\n\nAs shown later, some of the expressions for the likelihood can be simplified if any scale parameter in the distribution of the response, given the random effects, is incorporated into the covariance matrix of the random effects.  We define $\\mathbf{\\lambda}$ to be the lower triangular matrix with non-negative diagonal entries such that\n$$\n\\Sigma=\\sigma^2{\\bf\\lambda}{\\bf\\lambda}^\\prime\n$$\n\nIt helps to consider the example at this point to clarify these concepts.

        "## The Big Picture\n\nAlthough it is tempting to construct the model on a per-subject basis it is ultimately easier to consider the entire set of responses and the collection of all of the random effects together.  There are two reasons for this.  First, the parameters must be estimated from the complete data set.  Second, in situations where there is more than one grouping factor for the random effects it may not be possible to partition the responses according to the grouping factor.  In the sleepstudy example the 180 observations can be partitioned into eighteen groups of ten observations on each of the eighteen subjects.  However, in an example we will consider below each observation is on one of 56 subjects and one of 32 items and those classifications are _crossed_.  That is, each subject is tested on each item and each item is tested on each subject.  (Well, that was the plan at least.  As often happens a few observations were erroneously recorded so the factors are not completely crossed in the data after cleaning.)\n\nIn any case, we write $\\mathbf{b}$ for the complete random-effects vector (in this case a 36-dimensional vector formed from the $2\\times 18$ matrix in _column-major_ order)."

        "but there is no need to actually construct $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$.  It is completely determined by $\\mathbf{\\lambda}$.\n\n## Spherical random effects\n\nOne of the many useful properties of the normal distribution is that a scalar normal distribution, $\\mathcal{X}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$, can be expressed in terms of the _standard normal_ distribution, $\\mathcal{Z}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ as\n$$\n\\mathcal{X} = \\mu + \\sigma \\mathcal{Z}\n$$\nA similar result holds for the multivariate normal distribution.  The random effects vector, $\\mathcal{B}$, with distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\Sigma)$ can be generated from a \"spherical\" random effects vector, $\\mathcal{U}$, as\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} = \\Lambda \\mathcal{U}\\quad\\mathrm{where}\\quad\\mathcal{U}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\sigma^2\\mathbf{I}_q)\n$$\nand $q$ is the dimension of the random-effects vector (36 in our example).\n\n(Recall that a multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix $\\sigma^2\\mathbf{I}$ is called a \"spherical normal\" because the contours of constant probability density are spheres.  The random effects vector $\\mathcal{U}$ has such a spherical distribution.)\n\nNow the conditional distribution of the response, given the random effects, can be written in terms of $\\mathcal{U}$ as\n$$\n(\\mathcal{Y}|\\mathcal{U}=\\mathbf{u})\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mathbf{X\\beta}+\\mathbf{Z\\Lambda u}, \\sigma^2\\mathbf{I}_n\\right)\n$$\n\nThe joint probability density for $\\mathcal{Y}$ and $\\mathcal{U}$ is the product of the conditional density of $\\mathcal{Y}|\\mathcal{U}=\\mathbf{u}$ and the unconditional density of $\\mathcal{U}$.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{\\mathcal{Y},\\mathcal{U}}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{u})&= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{n/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X\\beta}-\\mathbf{Z\\Lambda u}\\|^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\,\\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{q/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{(n+q)/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X\\beta}-\\mathbf{Z\\Lambda u}\\|^2+\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEvaluating the likelihood requires the marginal distribution of $\\mathcal{Y}$.  This can be obtained by integrating the joint distribution, $f_{\\mathcal{Y},\\mathcal{U}}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{u})$, evaluated at the observed $\\mathbf{y}$, with respect to $\\mathbf{u}$. There is an analytic solution to this integral.  To derive this solution, we first write the penalized sum of squared residuals in a somewhat unusual but very useful form.
